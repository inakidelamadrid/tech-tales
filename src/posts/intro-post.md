## Intro

Many attempts have passed since I first tried to write my personal blog.

Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Django, Flask, Express ... I can't remember how many technologies I've tried to be honest.

Nevertheless, I tell you a truth. This is the latest and final attempt.

Its origin is an execution of will-power, of a desire to organize my mind. It's based on the cumulative learning of focused work and, a commitment.

I won't dissapoint. Neither you nor me. And I expect you find something useful in its lines.

## Let's get started: What do I do?

If you are not interested in knowing, you can go back to the list of blog posts.

But if you want to know more about me, either by curiosity or for business reasons: I do program web applications, mostly focused on the front end side.

Allow me mention to you the tech stack I'm confortable with

- Programming Languages
  - Javascript
  - Python
- Backend Application Programming Frameworks
  - Express JS
  - Nest JS
  - Django
  - Flask
- Front-end Application Programming Frameworks
  - React
  - Angular
  - Svelte
- Front-end Application Architectures
  - Micro frontends (Single SPA)

## Man, what would be writing / reading about in this blog?

Well, the most important objective in building this blog is to learn web development technologies but we'll also be learning very important stuff for us web developers, to focus and learning to learn.

And by doing how to write it in a **really approachable, easy and attractive manner**.

You name it: styling, scripting, HTTP protocol; the options are many. But we'll make sure we focus in solving a problem and to analyze and digest completely the technologies we'll use to do it.

It's a selfish exercise in that it will help me to better understand the topics and, at the same time selfless because I'll give my best to give you my **human** understanding (yes, you can also use AI these days, but it won't try to be funny as I will)
