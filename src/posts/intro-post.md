Alright, let's skip the whole "Hi, my name is..." routine because we both know that's not why you're here. You want code insights, not my life story. Fair enough.

## What This Blog Actually Is

This is a digital workshop where front-end meets back-end, where ideas get battle-tested, and where my ADHD-powered brain dumps the actually useful stuff I discover while building things

- Front-end: CSS (and its various frameworks), JavaScript, React, Angular
- Back-end: Node.js, Nest.js, Python
- Full-stack frameworks: Next.js, SvelteKit when I want to feel joy again
- General tooling: Shell scripting and other command-line wizardry
- Some devops stuff when I'm feeling particularly masochistic

## Why Another Dev Blog? (The Honest Truth)

Two reasons:

My brain is a chaotic vortex of programming knowledge that needs an organization system. This blog is that system.
I'm fighting the same demons you probably are: ADHD-induced procrastination, disorganized learning patterns, and the constant feeling that I should be coding better, or worst, _I should be coding productively_.

By writing here, I will force myself to truly understand what I'm sharing. _If I can't explain it clearly, I don't understand it well enough yet_. Simple as that.

## How This Place Works

This isn't just another wall of text on the internet. I'll be including:

- Interactive code samples that you can mess with
- Real problems I've solved (and the messy journey to those solutions)
- Concepts broken down without assuming you've memorized the entire documentation

Sometimes we'll dive deep into a single CSS property. Other times we'll architect entire systems. The common thread? Everything here is something I actually needed to learn and use.

## The Philosophy

Be curious, program knowing what you do, and do it well. Be a craftsman.

That's it. No 10x developer nonsense. No "hustle harder" toxic productivity. Just the pursuit of understanding our craft well enough to build things we're proud of.

## What's Next?

I've got a content pipeline planned out, but I'm not going to list 20 future topics that'll never happen. Instead, I'll tell you what's coming next week: [add here post 2].
If there's something specific in my tech stack you want me to cover, drop it in the comments. The ADHD part of me loves a good distraction if it's interesting enough.
Now let's get building something worth talking about.
